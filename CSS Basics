CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.

CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. Now let’s try to break the acronym:

        Cascading: Falling of Styles
        Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags
        Sheets: Writing our style in different documents
        
        Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, basic software installed, basic knowledge of working with files, and HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML.)
Objective:To understand the basics of linking a CSS document to an HTML file, and be able to do simple text formatting with CSS.
